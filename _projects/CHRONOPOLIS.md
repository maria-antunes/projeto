the_challenge_text: 
  - paragraph: CHRONOPOLIS is a speculative design project, which creates a city dominated by a machine where the day has 36 hours and each citizen is assigned a schedule that they are obliged to keep without question. 
  - paragraph: Based on the principles of creation of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) , we explore a new vision of temporality as well as technological advances, artificial intelligence and their role in society, authority and politics in contemporary times. 
  - paragraph: In this city there is no time waste. Everything is harmoniously coordinated so that life is calm and serene, and so that there is no room for setbacks or overlaps. The time for error has become null so that nothing could disturb the well being of all citizens. The city of time opens doors to all individuals who wish to have more time for themselves, for their leisure and for their rest. Do you submit yourself?
