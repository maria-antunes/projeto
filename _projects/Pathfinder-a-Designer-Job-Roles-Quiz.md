the_challenge_text: 
  - paragraph: When you are a designer, sometimes you don't know what to call yourself when people ask what you do because there are many roles, some of them even seem to overlap. 
  - paragraph: Additionally, when you want to get a job, you find yourself reading all the job offers' details trying to understand if you have the right skills because you don't know the correct term of what you actually do. With this solution we simplified the process of identifying the kind of designer that you are, so you can easily find the right job for you.
