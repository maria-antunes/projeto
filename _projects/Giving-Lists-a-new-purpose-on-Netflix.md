the_challenge_text:
  - paragraph: 'To develop a new feature for a worldwide application. We chose the famous Netflix streaming platform. Through research, we tried to understand the users pain points that we could turn into opportunities. In the end, we decided to invest in customization of the “my list” feature and allow more interaction through the platform.'
process_text: 
  - paragraph: 'Our process was divided in Research, Define, Ideation and Prototype.' 
  - paragraph: 'In the Research, phase we wanted to understand who Netflix competitors were and what they did differently and we interviewed four people to understand their use of Netflix better.'
  - paragraph: 'In the Define phase, after an affinity mapping group session, we came up with six insights to understand what we had to keep in mind creating this feature. From our insights, we created four HMW’s to frame our problem and better understand the opportunities. We decided to create a journey map. We follow the users experience since he opens Netflix until he starts watching the desired content. This allowed us to visualize the pain points.'
  - paragraph: 'In the Ideation phase, we started by putting ideas on paper and making our ideas tangible to discuss and find the best way to develop this feature. After having a clear idea of how everything would work out, we analysed Netflix UI and applied the same rules and guidelines to our prototype, focusing on the desktop browser version. Last but not least, we started user testing by defining some tasks and recruiting nine users to test the features. The results and feedback were mainly positive and the tasks completed.'
