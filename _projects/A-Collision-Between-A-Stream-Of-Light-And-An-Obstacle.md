  - paragraph: At the end of my degree I had the privilege to be part of the organising team for the 2020 Communication Design finalists show — A Collision between a Stream of Light and an Obstacle. The graduate show is the culmination of the work developed by the new graduates and aims to make known the projects developed in the last year of the degree.
